Recently, while working on a Lightning Web Component (LWC), I encountered the following error in the browser console:
> **Error fetching base URL: TypeError: Failed to execute 'dispatchEvent' on 'EventTarget': parameter 1 is not of type 'Event'.**

This seemed to happen while my component was trying to trigger or handle a custom event. If you‚Äôre seeing this error too, here's what might be causing it ‚Äî and how I resolved it using **Lightning Web Security (LWS)** settings.

---

## üîç What This Error Means


- This error generally occurs when `dispatchEvent()` is called with something that‚Äôs **not an actual `Event` object**.
- The issue can be caused by:
  - Incorrect use of custom events.
  - Mismatch between standard DOM `Event` and custom object/event structure.
  - Security layer constraints due to **Lightning Web Security (LWS)**.

## üí° My Specific Scenario


- I had a custom LWC using `dispatchEvent()` to communicate between components.
- Everything looked syntactically correct, but I was still seeing the error in the console.
- On deeper inspection, I found that the **Lightning Web Security (LWS)** setting was **disabled**, and **some standard DOM behavior was restricted**.

---

## üîß The Fix

Here‚Äôs what solved it for me:

- I explicitly enabled LWS in my org to avoid this issue.
- To do this:
  1. Go to your **Salesforce Setup**.
  2. Search for **‚ÄúSession Settings‚Äù**.
  3. Scroll down to the **Lightning Web Security** section.
  4. **Check the setting**:  
     `Enable Lightning Web Security for Lightning web components`
     
     ![lws](https://coded-by-pratiksha.github.io/assets/img/setup_lwsec_enable.avif)
     
  6. Save the changes.
  7. Refresh the app and test again.

This immediately resolved the error and allowed the `dispatchEvent()` to work correctly.

## üìò Helpful Salesforce Documentation

If you want to understand what LWS is and why this happens:

- [Lightning Web Security Overview](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/lightning-components-security/guide/get-started-intro.html)
- [Enable or Disable LWS](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/lightning-components-security/guide/lws-enable.html)

## üß† Takeaway


- When encountering unexpected JavaScript errors in LWC, **always check if LWS is involved**.
- This error specifically suggests an event compatibility issue ‚Äî most likely due to **changes introduced by LWS**.
- Enabling LWS is one fix, but be aware of the **security implications** in a production org.
- Always ensure that you're passing an actual Event or CustomEvent object to dispatchEvent().
