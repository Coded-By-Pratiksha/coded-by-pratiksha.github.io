Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Senior Salesforce Developer** with a strong passion for building scalable, efficient, and user-friendly solutions on the Salesforce platform. Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked across various Salesforce Clouds including Sales, Service, and Experience Cloud, and enjoy tackling everything from Apex triggers to Lightning Web Components.

This blog is my way of sharing the things I learn â€” sometimes the hard way â€” while working on real-world Salesforce problems. Whether it's understanding platform quirks, preparing for certifications, or decoding a strange error, I hope these posts help someone else in the ecosystem.

### What You'll Find Here

- Day-to-day Salesforce dev tips & tricks  
- Solutions to weird platform errors  
- My journey toward earning the **PD2 (Platform Developer II)** certification  
- Commonly asked **Salesforce interview questions** with explanations  
- Lightning Web Components, Apex, integrations & more  

### Why This Blog Exists

Because documentation is great â€” but real-world context is better. And letâ€™s be honest: sometimes even the best Googling doesnâ€™t help until you stumble upon a blog post with just the right answer. I want this to be that blog post for someone.

### Letâ€™s Connect

If you're a fellow developer, learner, or just curious about Salesforce, feel free to follow along. I'm excited to grow, build, and share â€” one post at a time.
